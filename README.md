# NVIDIA DLI Labs Repository

This repository contains code and materials for labs completed as part of the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) courses. Each lab focuses on specific topics related to deep learning and artificial intelligence.

## Usage

- These have been designed to run on Colab

## Lab 1: Image Classification with the MNIST Dataset

In this section we will do the "Hello World" of deep learning: training a deep learning model to correctly classify hand-written digits.

### Objectives

- Understand how deep learning can solve problems traditional programming methods cannot
- Learn about the MNIST handwritten digits dataset
- Use the torchvision to load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training
- Create a simple neural network to perform image classification
- Train the neural network using the prepped MNIST dataset
- Observe the performance of the trained neural network
